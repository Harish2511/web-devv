            <p style="color:cornflowerblue;">COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
            WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ 
            in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.</p></td>
        <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><h2 style="color: whitesmoke;">What key measures to protect against COVID-19 <br> should be undertaken in all workplaces?</h2>
        <p style="color: white;"> Measures to prevent transmission of COVID-19  include frequent hand-washing or disinfection with hand sanitizer, respiratory hygiene such as covering coughs,
            physical distancing of at least 1 metre, wearing of masks where distancing is not possible, regular environmental
           cleaning and disinfection, and limiting unnecessary travel.</p></td>
        <td bgcolor="white"><h2 style="color: cornflowerblue;"> How should I wash fruits and vegetables in time of COVID-19?</h2>
        <p style="color:cornflowerblue;">Wash fruit and vegetables the same way you would in any other circumstance. Before handling them, wash your hands
            with soap and water. Then wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw.  </p></td>

    <tr style="font-size: larger;">
        <td bgcolor="white"><h2 style="color: cornflowerblue;">What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h2>
        <p style="color:cornflowerblue;">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are Fever,Dry cough and Fatigue. </p>
        <p style="color:cornflowerblue;">Symptoms of severe COVID‐19 disease include:
           <ul style="color:cornflowerblue;"> 
            <li>Shortness of breath</li> 
            <li>Loss of appetite</li>

            <li>High temperature (above 38 °C).</li> 
        </ul></p></td>
        <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><h2 style="color: whitesmoke;">What are the rights,duties and responsibilities of workers?</h2>
        <p style="color:white;">Workers are responsible to follow the measures for occupational safety and health and 
            infection prevention ,and to participate in training provided by the employer. Workers should report 
            to their supervisor any situation which may present an imminent and serious danger to their life or health. Workers have the right to remove themselves 
            from any work situation with reasonable justification.</p></td>
        <td bgcolor="white"><h2 style="color: cornflowerblue;"> What is the best household disinfectant for surfaces?</h2> 
        <p style="color:cornflowerblue;">Regular household cleaning and disinfection products will effectively eliminate the virus from household surfaces.For cleaning and disinfecting 
            households with suspected or confirmed COVID19, surface virucidal disinfectants, such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and products based on
             ethanol (at least 70%), should be used. </p> </td>

    <tr style="font-size: larger;">
        <td bgcolor="white"><h2 style="color: cornflowerblue;"> How long it takes to develop symptoms?</h2>
        <p style="color:cornflowerblue;">The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 
                1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days,
                in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available.</p></td>
        <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><h2 style="color: whitesmoke;">What type of mask should a employee wear at workplace?</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Wearing masks depends on the risk assessment. For jobs and tasks that carry a medium or high risk, for people aged 60 and older, and
            for those with underlying health conditions, a medical mask and other personal protective equipment should be provided. Fabric masks or face coverings are currently 
            recommended for younger people. This prevents the spread of virus from the wearer to others.
           The policy on wearing a mask or face covering in low risk workplaces should be in line with national or local guidelines.
          <u> Masks may carry some risks if not used properly.</p></td>
        <td bgcolor="white"><h2 style="color: cornflowerblue;">What foods should be consumed to support the immune system?</h2>
        <p style="color:cornflowerblue;"></u> The immune system requires the support of many nutrients. It is recommended to consume a variety of foods for a healthy and
             balanced diet, including whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, nuts and animal source foods. There is no single food that will prevent you from catching 
             COVID-19.  For more information on a healthy diet</p> </td>
