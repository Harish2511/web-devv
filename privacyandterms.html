The only information we gather during general browsing is from standard server logs. These include your IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name, browser type, 
operating system, and information such as the web site that referred you to us, the files you download, the pages you visit, and the dates/times of those visits.

the site-specific policies will be complementary to this general  privacy policy but will give additional details for that particular site.

For certain  sites, registering or supplying personal information sets a cookie*. By setting this cookie, we will remember your details the next 
time you visit, so you don’t have to re-enter the information. This helps us to provide you with a better service.

information that you have volunteered. For open discussion groups, this information will be public.
