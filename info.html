    <h3 style="color: red; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: xx-large;">OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: x-large;">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered Coronavirus.
     <br>   
        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
        Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like  cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,
        and cancer are more likely to develop serious  illness.
        Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based sanitizer and rub frequently without touching your face. 
        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,
         so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
    <h1 style="color: red;" class="covid">HISTORY OF COVID-19</h1>
       <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: x-large;"> Coronaviruses are a big family of different viruses. Some of them cause the
        common cold in people. Others infect animals, including bats, camels, and cattle.we know about the virus that was first detected in
        <em style="color: red;"> Wuhan, China, in late 2019</em> and has set off a global pandemic.
        <br>
        Experts say <span style="color:red;">SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats</span>. That’s also how the coronaviruses behind <u style="color:red;">
        Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)</u> got started.
        <br> 
        SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan’s open-air <i style="color: red;">“wet markets.”</i> They’re where customers buy fresh meat and fish
        , including animals that are killed on the spot. Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like <em style="color: red;font-weight: bold;"> cobras,
        wild boars, and raccoon dogs.</em> Crowded conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. 
        <br> 
        As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct contact with animals. That meant the virus is transmitted from
        one human to another.
        This growing worldwide transmission is what is now a pandemic.

<tr><td> <h1 style="color: red;" class="covid">Coronavirus Evolution</h1> 
  <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: x-large;">Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in <em style="font-weight: bolder;">
    1965.</em> It caused a common cold. Later that decade, researchers found a group of similar human and animal viruses and named them after their 
    <em style="font-weight: bolder; color: red;"><u>crown-like appearance.</u></em> Seven coronaviruses can infect humans. The one that causes SARS emerged
    in southern China in 2002 and quickly spread to 28 other countries.
    <br>
    More than 8,000 people were infected by July 2003, and 774 died. A small outbreak in 2004 involved only four more cases. This coronavirus causes fever,
    headache, and respiratory problems such as cough and shortness of breath. MERS started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Almost all of the nearly 2,500 cases have been
    in people who live in or travel to the Middle East. This coronavirus is less contagious than its SARS cousin but more deadly, killing 858 people.</p></td>

        first found in London and Kent, a variant discovered in South Africa (referred to as B.1.351), and a variant discovered in Brazil (referred to as P.1). 
        Using whole genome sequencing, epidemiology and modelling suggest the UK variant VUI-202012/01 (the first variant under investigation in December 2020) 
        in the B.1.1.7 lineage transmits more easily than other strains.</em></p></div>
